# ChatGPT Equation Renderer

The ChatGPT Equation Renderer Chrome Extension is a tool that allows users to easily render equations in ChatGPT using LaTeX notation. The extension uses KaTeX, a fast and efficient LaTeX renderer, to ensure that equations are displayed accurately and quickly.

## Installation
This extension is [available in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-equation-renderer/nkkkaendbndanjjndfpebmekhgdjlhkh?hl).

To install the ChatGPT Equation Renderer Chrome Extension manually from this repository, follow these steps:

- Select the branch "build"
- Download the "extension" folder (it contains the already rendered extension) and place it somewhere safe
- Open Chrome, enable developer tools (upper right) and click on "Load unpacked"
- Select the extension folder that you downloaded
- You should be good to go


## Usage

To use the ChatGPT Equation Renderer Extension, simply open a ChatGPT conversation and click on the extension icon in the browser toolbar. This will open a popup with two buttons: "Prompt LaTeX" and "Render LaTeX".

Clicking "Prompt LaTeX" will request ChatGPT to use LaTeX notation for any equations in your responses. This will enable you to write equations using LaTeX notation directly in the chat box.

Once ChatGPT has understood that it has to use LaTeX notation for equations, click "Render LaTeX" to automatically render any mathematical expressions in your responses that use LaTeX notation. While this function is active, it will continue to render any new equations that appear in new ChatGPT responses.
